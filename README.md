# Spam-Classification-using-Python
Spam Classification in Google Colab.


I'd be glad to explain the code you provided and create a clear explanation for your GitHub README section:

Code Explanation:

1. Import Modules:

pandas (pd): Used for data manipulation and analysis (reading CSV, creating DataFrames, etc.)
nltk: A library for natural language processing tasks (stemming, stopwords removal, etc.)
2. Read Dataset:

df = pd.read_csv("spam.csv", encoding="latin-1"): Reads the "spam.csv" file into a pandas DataFrame named df. The encoding="latin-1" argument specifies the character encoding to handle potential issues with non-ASCII characters.
3. Explore the Data:

df.head(5): Shows the first 5 rows of the DataFrame to get a glimpse of the data.
df.shape: Displays the dimensions of the DataFrame (number of rows and columns).
df.drop(columns=['Unnamed: 2', 'Unnamed: 3', 'Unnamed: 4'], inplace= True): Removes unnecessary columns starting with "Unnamed" from the DataFrame (assuming they don't contain relevant information). The inplace=True argument modifies the DataFrame itself instead of creating a copy.
df.rename(columns={'v1' : 'class', 'v2' : 'sms'}, inplace= True): Renames columns "v1" to "class" (presumably indicating spam or ham) and "v2" to "sms" for better readability.
4. Analyze Class Distribution:

df.groupby('class').describe(): Provides descriptive statistics (count, unique values, top frequency, etc.) for each class ("ham" and "spam") in the "sms" column.
5. Remove Duplicates:

df = df.drop_duplicates(keep='first'): Removes duplicate rows, keeping the first occurrence of each unique message. The keep='first' argument ensures only the first instance is retained.
6. Data Visualization:

df["Length"] = df["sms"].apply(len): Adds a new column named "Length" that calculates the length (number of characters) of each SMS message using the apply() function. We've addressed the warning here by using .apply() instead of direct assignment, which can cause issues with modifying copies.
df.hist(column='Length', by='class', bins=50): Creates a histogram to visualize the distribution of message lengths for "ham" and "spam" classes using 50 bins.
7. Text Preprocessing:

import nltk: Imports the nltk library again (sometimes needed after code blocks).
from nltk.stem.porter import PorterStemmer: Imports the Porter Stemmer for reducing words to their base forms (e.g., "running" becomes "run").
nltk.download('stopwords'): Downloads the stopwords list (common words like "the," "a," "an") if not already downloaded.
from nltk.corpus import stopwords: Imports stopwords functionality from the NLTK corpus.
nltk.download('punkt'): Downloads the sentence tokenizer if not already downloaded.
ps = PorterStemmer(): Creates a Porter Stemmer object for stemming.
8. Preprocessing Tasks:

- Lowercasing: You haven't explicitly shown the code for lowercasing, but it's a common preprocessing step. Here's how to add it:

Python
def preprocess_text(text):
  """Lowercases, tokenizes, removes special characters, stop words, and stems text."""
  text = text.lower()  # Convert to lowercase
  tokens = nltk.word_tokenize(text)  # Tokenize into words
  # Remove special characters (you can define a custom function for this)
  # tokens = [word for word in tokens if word.isalnum()]
  filtered_tokens = [word for word in tokens if word not in stopwords.words('english')]  # Remove stop words
  stemmed_tokens = [ps.stem(word) for word in filtered_tokens]  # Apply stemming
  return stemmed_tokens

Tokenization: This code snippet is missing, but it involves splitting the text into individual words or meaningful units.
Removing Special Characters: You can add a custom function to remove punctuation or other unwanted characters as needed.
Removing Stop Words and Punctuation: The code demonstrates removing stop words using stopwords.words('english'), but you can modify it to remove punctuation as well (see the commented-out line in the preprocess_text function).
